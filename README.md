# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! 🚀

This repository is a collection of my solutions to various problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). I aim to track my progress, improve my coding skills, and share my approaches to different algorithmic challenges. Each solution is written in a structured and comprehensible manner.

## 📚 Repository Structure

All solutions are stored in a single folder for simplicity. Each file is named after the LeetCode problem title, or its ID, for quick reference.

```
leetcode-solutions/
├── Problem1_Solution.py
├── Problem2_Solution.py
├── Problem3_Solution.py
└── README.md
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-Doye/leetcode-solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder containing the solutions.
3. Open the file corresponding to the problem you're working on.

Each solution file includes:
- My approach to solving the problem.
- The implemented code.

## 🌟 Goals

- Consistently practice algorithmic problems to strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Document solutions for future reference.
- Share insights and approaches with others in the coding community.
